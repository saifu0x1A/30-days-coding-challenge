# 30-days-coding-challenge
In this 30-day challenge, I committed to developing consistency in my coding journey. The goal was to solve 2 DSA problems daily, limit distractions by avoiding unnecessary scrolling, something like that.

Throughout the challenge, I tracked my progress with bi-weekly updates on LinkedIn and committed daily code to GitHub. This journey helped me build discipline, expand my skills, and stay on track with learning. Even though it took more than 30 days due to a break in the streak, Iâ€™m proud to have completed it!
